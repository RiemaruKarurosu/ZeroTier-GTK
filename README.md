## How to Contribute
If you are interested in contributing to ZeroTier-GTK, please refer to the project's [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/RiemaruKarurosu/ZeroTier-GTK/wiki/How-to-contribute). Additionally, you can find documentation for the Zerotierlib used in this project [here](https://github.com/RiemaruKarurosu/ZeroTier-GTK/wiki/Zerotierlib-DOCS-v.1.4#zerotiernetwork/).

## Troubleshooting
As mentioned earlier, ZeroTier-GTK is still in development and should not be used for actual purposes. Therefore, troubleshooting guidance is not available at this time.

## Alternatives
If you require a working solution for managing ZeroTier networks, you can consider using the original [ZeroTier-GUI](https://github.com/tralph3/ZeroTier-GUI) project. It is a well-established and functional application that has undergone a rewrite.
